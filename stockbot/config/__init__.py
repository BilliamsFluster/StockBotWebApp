"""Configuration package.

This module houses YAML configuration files and helper functions for
loading runtime settings.  Configuration is broken out into
multiple files for clarity: one for global settings, one for
strategyâ€‘specific options, one for model parameters, and one for
LLM/Jarvis settings.  These files are read by the main entry point
to configure the trading bot.

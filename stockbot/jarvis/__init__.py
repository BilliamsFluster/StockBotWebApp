"""Jarvis LLM oversight layer.

The jarvis package provides an interface for a large language model
that monitors the botâ€™s performance and suggests strategy adjustments.
In this prototype the LLM functionality is simulated using simple
heuristics in the `Analyzer`.  The `Agent` coordinates periodic
analysis according to the configuration and applies suggestions via
`StrategyFeedback`.

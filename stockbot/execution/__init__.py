"""Execution layer for placing and managing trades.

The execution package contains classes that interface with broker APIs
or simulated brokers.  The `BaseBroker` defines a common API for
submitting orders and tracking positions.  The `PaperBroker` is a
simple inâ€‘memory broker used for backtesting and simulation.  A
placeholder `SchwabBroker` shows where live trading support would
reside.  The `ExecutionManager` coordinates order submission from
strategies to the broker and could be extended to support advanced
order types and throttling.

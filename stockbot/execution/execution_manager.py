"""Highâ€‘level wrapper around a broker for submitting orders.

The `ExecutionManager` coordinates trade execution on behalf of the
strategy.  It could be extended to batch orders, handle order types
other than simple market orders, or integrate asynchronous order
confirmation.  In this prototype it simply passes market orders
through to the underlying broker.
